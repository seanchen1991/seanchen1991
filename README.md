## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sean, a software educator, storyteller, and engineer. I've worked across multiple domains throughout my 10+ year career, but education and developer relations are where I am most aligned. 

I thoroughly enjoy writing as a way to teach myself new things. One of the best parts about it is being able to share those writings with others. Below is a sample of some of the things that I'm proud to have worked on:

### Documentation

- [Hermes documentation][hermes-docs]: Docs site for the Hermes relayer, which I was an active maintainer of. These used by hundreds of validators in the Cosmos ecosystem as a reference for operating the Hermes relayer.

- [Hermes architecture overview][hermes-arch]: An overview of the high-level architecture of the Hermes relayer, meant to educate those new to the Cosmos ecosystem about how Hermes works.

- [IBC ADR][ibs-rs-adr]: An Architecture Decision Record detailing a proposal to refactor the error handling system of the ibc-rs library, to communicate breaking changes with users and maintainers.

### Teaching Posts

- [Rust Error Handling][rust-error-handling]: A blog post that walks through different idioms for handling errors in the Rust programming language.

- [Implementing an LRU Cache in Rust][rust-lru]: A blog post that walks through implementing an LRU cache data structure in the Rust programming language.

### Conference Talks

- [The Anatomy of Error Messages in Rust][rust-talk]: A talk I gave at Rust Fest that delves into how the Rust compiler structures and surfaces its legendary error messages.

### Podcasts

- [Building with Rust][bwr]: A podcast I hosted where we interviewed and highlighted the work of open source maintainers in the Rust ecosystem.

- [Informal Conversations][informal-conversations]: A podcast I started while working at Informal Systems that delves into the people and stories behind the Cosmos ecosystem.
